# Banking System
A simple set of code that allows you to register an account and log in to deposit and withdraw money

## Description
This code allows a user to create an account using an email (doesn't require an actual email) and password with options to add a verification code. 
Once logged in you are able to deposit, withdraw, check balance and configure settings. This shows my knowledge of Java and Object-Orientated 
Programming that I am progressively learning through U-demy.
