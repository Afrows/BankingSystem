# Banking System
A simple set of code that allows you to register an account and log in to deposit and withdraw money

## Description
This code allows a user to create an account using an email (doesn't require an actual email) and password with options to add a verification code. 
Once logged in you are able to deposit, withdraw, check balance and configure settings. This shows my knowledge of Java and Object-Orientated 
Programming that I am progressively learning through U-demy. This is just the foundational start of what I will add later on, my goal is to have 
security features and a functional logging system.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies 
This project requires a Java Development Kit to run. A common version is [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org)<br> 17 or 21.
An IDE also is need to view and run the code, as it was made with [InteliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#)<br> I recommend installing it.
Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)<br> installed aswell.
